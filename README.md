# Secure-Wireless-IoTNet-Using-VPNs

## Abstract 

The Internet of Things (IoT) is an exploding market as well as a important focus area for research. Security is a major issue for IoT products and solutions, with several massive problems that are still commonplace in the field. In this paper, we have successfully minimized the risk of data eavesdropping and tampering over the network by securing these communications using the concept of tunneling. We have implemented this by connecting a router to the internet via a Virtual Private network while using PPTP and L2TP as the underlying protocols for the VPN and exploring their cost benefits, compatibility and most importantly, their feasibility. The main purpose of our paper is to try to secure IoT networks without adversely affecting the selling point of IoT.
